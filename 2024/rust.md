## What is Rust?

Rust is an open-source, systems programming language that you can use to develop efficient, safe software. With Rust, you can manage memory and control other low-level details. But you can also take advantage of high-level concepts like iteration and interfaces. These features set Rust apart from low-level languages like C and C++.

Rust also offers the following advantages that make it a great fit for a wide range of applications:

- `Type safe:` The compiler assures that no operation will be applied to a variable of a wrong type.
- `Memory safe:` Rust pointers (known as references) always refer to valid memory.
- `Data race free:` Rust's borrow checker guarantees thread-safety by ensuring that multiple parts of a program can't mutate the same value at the same time.
- `Zero-cost abstractions:` Rust allows the use of high-level concepts, like iteration, interfaces, and functional programming, with minimal to no performance costs. The abstractions perform as well, as if you wrote the underlying code by hand.
- `Minimal runtime:` Rust has a minimal and optional runtime. The language also has no garbage collector to manage memory efficiently. In this way, Rust is most similar to languages like C and C++.
- `Targets bare metal:` Rust can target embedded and "bare metal" programming, making it suitable to write an operating system kernel or device drivers.


## When to use Rust
The Rust language has many strengths to consider when choosing the best language for your project:

- Rust allows for control over the performance and resource consumption of programs and libraries written in the language on par with C and C++, while still being memory safe by default. This level of control eliminates entire classes of common bugs.
- Rust has rich abstraction features that allow developers to encode many of the invariants of their program into code. the code is then checked by the compiler instead of relying on convention or documentation. This feature can often lead to the feeling of "if it compiles, it works."
- Rust has built-in tools for building, testing, documenting, and sharing code as well as a rich ecosystem of third-party tools and libraries. These tools can make some tasks that are difficult in some languages, such as building dependencies, easy and productive in Rust.
