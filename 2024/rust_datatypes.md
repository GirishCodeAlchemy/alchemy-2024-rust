# Datatypes and variables

Rust is a `statically typed` language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

## Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

### 1. Integer Type

integer (signed integer types start with i instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space.

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

`Signed` and `unsigned` refer to whether itâ€™s possible for the number to be negativeâ€”in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned).

| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

> Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses

> So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127.

> Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

| Number literals | Example     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Decimal         | 98_222      |
| Hex             | 0xff        |
| Octal           | 0o77        |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only)  | b'A'        |

> **So how do you know which type of integer to use? If youâ€™re unsure, Rustâ€™s defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to i32. The primary situation in which youâ€™d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.**

### 2. Floating-point Type

The default type is `f64`. All floating-point types are signed.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64
    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

### 3. Numeric Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

### 4. Boolean Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

### 5. Character type

specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

## variables

By default, variables are immutable

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

> error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

## constants

Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

## Shadowing

We can shadow a variable by using the same variableâ€™s name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword.

the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

> This program first binds x to a value of 5. Then it creates a new variable `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding 1 so the value of x is then 6. Then, within an inner scope created with the curly brackets, the third let statement also shadows x and creates a new variable, multiplying the previous value by 2 to give x a value of 12. When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and x returns to being 6

```bash
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

> The first spaces variable is a string type and the second spaces variable is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as spaces_str and spaces_num; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name.
